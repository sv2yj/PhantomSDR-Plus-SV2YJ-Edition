/**
 * diversity.js — two-site receive diversity combiner for PhantomSDR-Plus
 *
 * Takes the local /audio PCM stream plus a second stream from a remote
 * receiver (see remoteSource.js) and emits ONE PCM stream that follows
 * whichever site currently has the better signal.
 *
 * WHY SELECTION AND NOT SUMMING
 * -----------------------------
 * Two receivers hundreds of km apart hear the same transmission over
 * different ionospheric paths, so the two audio waveforms have unrelated
 * phase and slightly different Doppler.  Adding them sounds hollow and
 * comb-filtered — the classic "phasey" artefact.  Maximal-ratio combining
 * needs sample-coherent streams off a common clock, which two independent
 * WebSDRs over the internet can never provide.  So this switches between
 * them (selection combining) and only ever mixes the two during a 30 ms
 * crossfade, where the artefact is inaudible.
 *
 * The payoff is therefore continuity, not raw SNR: deep fades decorrelate
 * between distant sites, so when site A drops into a fade site B usually
 * has not, and you keep copy through it.
 *
 * HOW ALIGNMENT WORKS
 * -------------------
 * The two streams are correlated on their AUDIO ENVELOPES (log power,
 * decimated to 100 Hz), never on the waveforms.  Waveform correlation
 * fails outright here for the same phase reason as above; the envelope —
 * syllable structure — survives both the path and any codec, and is ~120x
 * cheaper to correlate.
 *
 * Envelope combining tolerates ~10 ms of alignment error, and clock drift
 * between two sites is on the order of 1 ms per 1000 s, so the delay
 * estimate only needs refreshing about once a minute.
 *
 * TIMEBASE
 * --------
 * The LOCAL stream is the timebase, because it already drives playback
 * scheduling in audio.js (this.playTime).  The remote is buffered and read
 * against the local cadence, never the reverse.  If the remote stalls or
 * underruns, output falls back to local immediately — silence is never an
 * acceptable outcome of a listening aid.
